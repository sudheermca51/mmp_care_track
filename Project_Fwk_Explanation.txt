Description:
MMP is web based application developed in the PHP[HyperText Pre-Processor] Sciprting language.
MMP has two different modules one is Patient and Admin module.
Its related to Patient Portal where the patients can directly acces the website and perfrom the following actions in teh website.
1. Book Appointment
2. Send Messages
3. Information
4. Pay Fees
5. login
6. logout
7. Register 
8. Profile - Edit/Cancel

10. View the reports 

Similar Patient Portal there is an Admin Portal where the Admin can directly access the webstie to perform the following actions
1. Book Appointment for a patient
2. Retrieve the infromation of the messages snt by patient
3. Submit the reports
4. REquest the patient to pay the fees


Roles & Responsbilities:
1. Framework
		As part of the project we have used the Hybrid Framework the combination of Modular + Data Driven
		
		Modular : Identify the testscenario's and resuable steps and convert into methods
		Data Driven: Maintain the input data in a 3rd patry  resource file.

		a. Helper Class
				1. Login
				2. Navigation 
				3. LaunchBrowser
		b. AppLibrary
				1. Get Future Date- 
				2. Generate random numbers
				3. Read XLSX / XLS / Database
		c. BaseClass
				1. instantiate Driver-> extended by TestCAse Class 
				2. protected variables
				3. @BeforeClass annotation is added
				4. All the properties stored in the configuration file are read in this BaseClass 
				
		d. config.properties
				1. all the key values are maintained for project. username and password
				2. BrowserType
				3. patient details : username/password/url
				4. admin details: username/password/url
				5. environment:qa/dev/pre-prod 
				
		PageObject Model:
				Actions performed in each every page are maintained in the Page Object class
				This will helps in reusability and avoid redundancy and easy maintainenance 
2. Test Case Automation:For Sprint [n] the testcases are automated in [n+1] th sprint 
		Sprint 1:
		Sprint 2: Sprint 1 testcases are automated. In General we automate Sprint n-1 testcases in Sprint n.
		2 automation tester and 4 manual tester in the team.
		10 developers+ 4 tester + 2 automation

		TESTNG + MAVEN PROJECT + DEPENDENCIES+PLUGINS 
3. Maintain the source code in the repo
		Github: master
			clone of the master and create a branch do the changes
			get the PR created and assigned to reviewer
			once reviewed merged into the master branch
4. Execution

			Jenkins: to trigger the testcases
				1. download the repo code with master branch
				2. execute tests
					mvn clean test->pom.xml->testng.xml->@Test


5. Challenges: 95 % automation is completed

       5% -> Image verification is not possible
	   
	   Pop-up ->windows Auto IT 
	   Flakiness->  100 Tests -> 60 passed / 40 failed 
	                40 - analyse ->timeouts/build isssues/UI  
	   Scalability - > Grouping in Testng
